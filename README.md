PIDelonghi (a wordplay on PID and Delonghi) is an [PID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) temperature controller for the delonghi EC155 espresso machine.

The EC155 is a very affodable Espressoe machine with a capable pump. The one down side of the machine (beside the presurized portafilter) is the horrible temperature stability.

The goal of this project is to replace the [bimetallic temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimetallic_strip) sensors with a more accurate and stable PID controller.

For now this is very much work in progress, so while we invite you to play around with this, don;t rely on this for your daily coffee.
